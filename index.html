            <p>Around 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health issue at some point in their lives, which is about 25% of the population. Each year, about 18-20% of people may deal with mental health problems like anxiety or depression. These numbers can change based on factors like age, where people live, and how easy it is for them to get help. In New Zealand, almost half of the population will face mental health challenges at some point, with a noticeable increase in stress among young people. Worldwide, anxiety and depression are the most common mental health problems. This shows how important it is to have access to mental health support and resources.
