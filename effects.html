        <h2> REDUCED PRODUCTIVITY</h2>
          <P>When your mind is clouded, it’s like trying to drive through heavy fog. Tasks that were once clear and simple now seem confusing.  Deadlines that used to motivate you now slip past unnoticed, blending into a haze of anxiety and procrastination. Motivation stalls and creativity withers, leaving you stuck in place like a car trapped in thick mud. Every small hill transforms into an insurmountable mountain, and even the tiniest 
            obstacles seem to drain your energy and willpower. The world outside keeps moving forward, but inside, you feel trapped in slow motion, struggling just to keep up.</P>

            <h2>Suicide Risk</H2>
            
            <p>One of the most serious effects of poor mental health is an increased risk of suicide. Feelings of hopelessness, deep depression, or emotional pain can lead individuals to believe there's no way out. Common warning signs include withdrawing from others, drastic mood changes, and expressing thoughts of death. Early intervention, open conversations, and access to mental health care are critical 
                in preventing suicide and saving lives.</p>
                  <h3>“Sometimes the loudest cries are silent.”</h3>
            <ul> 
             <li>Deep depression and hopelessness are major suicide risk factors.</li>
            <li>Warning signs include withdrawal, mood changes, and expressions of worthlessness.</li>
            <li>Talking about suicidal thoughts is not attention-seeking—it's a call for help.</li>
            <li>Early support can stop a crisis before it starts.</li>
             </ul>
